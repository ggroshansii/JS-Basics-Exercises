Is there a method to capitalize a string, for example turning 'mountain' into 'Mountain'?


Solution

There is no built-in method for capitalizing a string. If we wanted to have such a method, we would have to implement it ourselves.

Discussion

Searching MDN for capitalize does not yield any string methods as results. In order to be sure that there really is no method, being called and described differently, you can check the MDN reference page for String: it lists all methods that are available for strings.
