How can we access the element 'and' in the array ['fish', 'and', 'chips']?


Solution

['fish', 'and', 'chips'][1];

Or:

let dinner = ['fish', 'and', 'chips'];
dinner[1];
See the MDN page on Array.

Discussion

We can use bracket notation to access the array element at a particular index. In JavaScript, arrays have a zero-based index. This means that the first element in the array will have an index of 0, the second element will have an index of 1, and so on.
